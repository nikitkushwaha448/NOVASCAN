### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd StartupRadar
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create `.env`:

```bash

# Google Cloud / Vertex AI
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="us-central1"
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<service-account-json or base64>"

### 3. Authenticate with Google Cloud

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project your-project-id
```

### 4. Set Up Elasticsearch Index

```bash
npm run setup-es
```

This creates the `social_signals` index with mappings for:

- Dense vectors (768 dimensions)
- Sentiment analysis fields

- Platform metadata

### 5. (Optional) Enable AI Reranking

Prerequisites:

1. Enable Discovery Engine API in Google Cloud Console

```bash
npm run setup-reranking
```

This creates the Vertex AI reranking inference endpoint using Elastic's Open Inference API.

### 6. Collect Initial Data

```bash
npm run collect-data
```

Fetches ~100 posts from Reddit, Hacker News, YouTube, Product Hunt and indexes with embeddings. Takes about 5-10 minutes.

### 7. Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Challenges I Faced

- **Deduplication** turned into a bigger problem than expected. The same discussion often appears multiple times, sometimes with slight title variations or different URLs. I built a normalization system that strips protocols and URL parameters, normalizes titles by removing punctuation and truncating to 100 characters. Even then, some duplicates slip through when titles are significantly reworded.

- **API rate limits** hit hard once I started scaling data collection. YouTube's quota system is particularly brutal—you burn through your daily limit fast. Reddit blocks you if you make requests too quickly. I added delays between requests (1 second for Reddit, 2 seconds for embedding batches) and implemented `Promise.allSettled` so one platform failure doesn't kill the entire collection job.

- **Platform-specific quirks** created a normalization nightmare. **Product Hunt** uses GraphQL with nested topic structures (`topics.edges[].node.name`), **Reddit** has inconsistent formats where `selftext` might be empty and timestamps are in Unix seconds, **YouTube** requires two API calls (search, then fetch details) with engagement metrics as strings needing parsing, and **HackerNews** has two separate APIs (Firebase and Algolia) with stories that can be `deleted` or `dead`. I solved this with a unified **`SocialPost` interface** that normalizes everything—YouTube's `likeCount` and Reddit's `score` both map to a generic `score` field, all timestamp formats convert to JavaScript `Date` objects, and each connector has a `normalize` function.

- **The background collection pipeline** needed careful orchestration. Fetching from four platforms, running sentiment analysis, calculating quality scores, generating embeddings, and bulk indexing—all while handling partial failures gracefully. I use `Promise.allSettled` everywhere, so one platform timeout doesn't break the entire job.

## What's Next

- **Validation API performance** - The `/api/validate-idea` endpoint takes nearly a minute to complete. The main bottleneck is sequential Gemini calls and Elasticsearch searches. **Solution: Multi-layer caching.** Cache Elasticsearch results for identical search queries (1-hour TTL), cache generated embeddings for common keywords, and cache entire validation reports for identical ideas (6-hour TTL). This could drop response time from 60 seconds to under 2 seconds for cache hits. Redis with query hash keys would handle this cleanly.

- **Authentication & rate limiting** - Currently everything is public with no usage tracking. Adding NextAuth or Clerk would enable user accounts, and token bucket rate limiting per user would prevent abuse.

- **Better deduplication** - The current URL/title normalization still lets duplicates through when titles are significantly reworded. A similarity-based approach using embeddings could catch near-duplicates more effectively.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add more platforms (X, GitHub, Stackoverflow, Quora)
- [ ] Multi-layer caching (Redis) for validation API
- [ ] Authentication system (NextAuth/Clerk)
- [ ] Add export functionality (CSV, PDF reports)
- [ ] Multi-lingual support
- [ ] Browser extension for on-the-fly validation
